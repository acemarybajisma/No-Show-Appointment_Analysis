## Dataset Description
In this project, I analyzed the no-show-appointments dataset to investigate the factors that determines whether a patient will show up for a scheduled appointment or not. In particular, I explored how the nature of the patient sickness(es) affects their showing up.
## Summary of Findings

    It was discovered that both genders (male and female) showed up equally for an appointment.
    From analysis, patients without any of the sicknesses (hypertension, diabetes and alcoholism) showed up more for appointments.
    Hypertension recorded the highest number of patients suffering from it with 65.9%.

    Females suffered more from hypertension.
    Females suffered more from diabetes.
    Males suffered more from alcoholism.

    From analysis,

    JARDIM CAMBURI neighbourhood had the highest number of records.
    All records from JARDIM DA PENHA and SANTA MARTHA neighourhoods showed up for their appointment.
    All records from ITARARE and CENTRO neighbourhoods didn't show for their appointments.

    Majority of people who showed up for appointments were people not enrolled in the scholarship program which was 72.3%.
    Majority of people who showed up for appointments were people who did not receive an sms which was 56.6%.
    From analysis,

    The highest appointment turn out were from adults followed by children.
    The lowest appointment turn out were from infants followed by young adults.

    There were more appointment turn out from patients whose scheduled day was their appointment day (approximately 95%) compared to those whose appointment day     was different from their scheduled day (approximately 71%).
